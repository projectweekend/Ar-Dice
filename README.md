An Arduino sketch for electronic dice using two LED matrices &amp; buttons

### Parts

These are the parts I used to build this project. Everything except the LED matrices should be pretty interchangeable. As long as your Arduino supports [I2C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I²C) (almost all of them do)

* [Full Sized Breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/products/239) (x1) - This has plenty of room to accomodate the rest of the parts listed below.
* [Breadboarding Wires](https://www.adafruit.com/products/153) - It's always good to have a bunch of these laying around. How else are you going to connect things?
* [Colorful Round Tactile Button](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1009) (x2) - Again, I used two of these, one to control the roll for each die. I like these buttons because they have a nice size and feel. With that said, pretty much any type of button works here too.
* [Adafruit Mini 8x8 LED Matrix w/I2C Backpack](https://www.adafruit.com/products/870) (x2) - I used two of these, one for each electronic die. Adafruit offers them in a variety of colors.
* [Arduino Pro Mini 328 - 5V/16MHz](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11113) (x1) - I chose this Arduino because I had it laying around. Any model that supports [I2C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I²C) will do an equally fine job.
